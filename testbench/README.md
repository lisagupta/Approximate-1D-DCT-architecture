This folder contains the Testbenches to trigger the architecture. Their output waveform can be seen on the Vivado Simulator.<br/>The main testbench for the top module is pipeline_tb, which takes the generated text file (as mentioned earlier) as input. The other module, serial_tb is a separated testbech for the serial adder module. It can be used to check its functionality as an independent module.
