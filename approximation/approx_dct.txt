This implementation reduces the 1-dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform to a simple matrix operation followed by a few scaling processes. This design is inspired from the paper ![Design of 8-Point DCT Architecture with 12Addition Only for Image Compression](chrome-extension://oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm/https://www.rsisinternational.org/Issue13/36-39.pdf). Thus the output generated is not exact, but as presented in the paper, it incorporates tolerable errors for the use in image compression modules. The paper also suggests the extension to 2D DCT computation by adding a transpose block and another similar grid to compute 1D DCT for the column vectors.  
This design also incorporates a new technique to compute the approximated sum of 9 bit numbers with hardware supporting 8 bit addition. It ignores the carry generated at the LSB and hence the maximum error possible, is limited by the value 2. Moreover, specifically in the image compression domain, the output shall pass through other stages involving Quantization and thus the LSB value will no longer remain significant. This allows the architecture to ignore the error and process the 9-bit input with the same hardware.
